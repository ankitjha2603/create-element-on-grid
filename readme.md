# Interactive 3D Grid Environment

This project leverages the power of Three.js to create an interactive 3D grid environment where users can generate and delete objects with mouse interactions.

## Features

- **3D Grid**: A grid pattern serves as the base for object placement and interaction.
- **Cursor Interaction**: Mouse movement highlights grid squares, providing visual cues.
- **Object Generation**: Double-clicking adds rotating diamond-like objects to the grid.
- **Object Deletion**: Right-clicking removes previously placed objects.
- **Continuous Animation**: Objects rotate smoothly to enhance visual appeal.
- **Camera Control**: Adjust the camera perspective with intuitive mouse controls.
- **Responsive Design**: The scene adapts seamlessly to window resizing.
